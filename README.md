# rust_practice
A repo to save all of my files in my journey to learn rust.

Rust is supposed to be very fast and only limited by your hardware. It's also supposed to not have any memory leaks, patching a whole lot of bugs. Hopefully that's all true because that's why I want to learn rust lol

Note to self:
If I can't stage a folder made with cargo that is inside another folder that has been initialized, it's because cargo automatically makes the folder a git repo. You have to do:
'cd path/to/repo
rm -rf .git'
to un-initialize the cargo folder. Then it'll be all fixed :D
(3 days of my life wasted instead of learning rust)
