    // they are integers, characters (more than just ascii), floats, and booleans

    // there are a few types of integers
    // there are unsigned and signed integers from 8 to 128 bits
    
    // PREFIXING UNUSED VARIABLES WITH AN UNDERSCORE _

    // same integer rules and stuff

    // addition

    // subtraction

    // remainder
    // two ints make an int with modulus

    // on to compound types 
    // rust has arrays (like java) and tuples (like python)
    // these are the two 'primitive' compound types

    // you can define different types for each value in the tuples
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    // you can define variables off of tuples

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
    println!("The value of z is: {z}");

    // get individual values from tuples
    let _five_hundred = tup.0;


    // arrays have a fixed length
    // more complicated arrays and stuff like arraylists are vectors in rust
    // they're defined by square brackets
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // define array type 
    let array: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // same thing as let array = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
    let array = [3; 5];

    // access index of an array
